## Workshops

### "Proposing Your First Tech Conference Talk"

A three-part half-day workshop

**PART 1 (Talk)**
A presentation focused on why to become a tech conference speaker, qualifications, benefits & tradeoffs, and how to find and evalute CFPs for strategic fit.

**PART 2 (Q&A Session)**
An extensive and lengthy Q&A session. The workshop participants posed a deluge of great questions — not just about entering speaking but also how to deal with things that come after it. My favorite part of giving this talk & workshop is getting to learn what else what people need demystified. There's so much. When it comes to tech conference speaking, virtually everything aspect and step is a mystery to newcomers.

**PART 3 (Breakout Groups)**
When giving this [workshop at Girl Develop It Raleigh](http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-RDU/events/225089443/), Conference organizer and speaker [Bridget Kromhut](https://twitter.com/bridgetkromhout) and speaker [Yoko Harada](https://twitter.com/yokolet) generously volunteered to each mentor a breakout group. The three of us each helped particants brainstorm talk ideas and shape those into something concrete, exciting, and targeted.

*Every* participant had at least one idea that would be a compelling topic for conference program committees and audience to see. Even participants who initially said "I don't have anything that I could speak about" started to embrace what veteran speakers know: Yes, you do. Really. Everybody does. Communicating effectively about it is where the hard work is. 

It's a delight afterward to here from women announcing that they put in their first proposal immediately after the workshop. Score!


## Be a Workshop Sponsor
Expanding the workshop to a full day would make it possible to give attendees more individualized coaching on conference targeting and writing abstracts. Those are crucial takeaways.

People of all genders are welcome at CallbackWomen workshops. It's terrific to see cis men attend as guest of an enthusistic participant who is another gender.
