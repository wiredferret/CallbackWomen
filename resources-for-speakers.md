## Conferences

### Why Attend

Peers. Do you crave having more? Feel isolated from others who do what you do? Conferences connect people. You carry that sense of connectedness back home with you.

Sense of connection to something bigger. Pride in being part of that community.

have/hear different discussions than the same predictable stuff at the office.

### Why Speak

"I would really love to discuss that w/you more…" Surprising opportunities come out of those.

ppl who you admire introduce self to you, recognize you as peer, become fan of your work too!  (including “well-known” ppl you thought would never talk to you!)

challenge. Nudge self to learn, then share, something new b/c you've proposed to talk abt it.

thought leadership. Speaking abt a topic can earn rep as someone whose thoughts on it matter.
